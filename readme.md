# Assignment README 🚀

This repository contains the completed assignments for a data-driven adventure where we harnessed the power of Snowflake and created a dynamic Streamlit app to explore the world of data.

## Part 1: Predict Ad Impressions with Snowflake 📈

### Tutorial Completion ✅

In the first leg of our journey, we embarked on a thrilling tutorial provided by Snowflake to predict ad impressions using ML-powered analysis. Here's what we accomplished:

- 📚 Followed the [Predict Ad Impressions Tutorial](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/predict_ad_impressions_with_ml_powered_analysis/index.html#0) on Snowflake's website.

- 🚀 Successfully deployed the ad impressions prediction model.

### Streamlit App 🌟

To make our journey even more exciting, we built a Streamlit app that lets you interact with the ad impressions prediction model. It's a two-part adventure!

#### 1. Link to Access the public streamlit app
[Predict AD Impressions Streamlit App]()
#### 2. How to Use the Streamlit App locally:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
   2. Change Directory 

   ```
   cd part_1
   ```
3. Create environment
```
conda create --name snowpark-de-ml1 python==3.9.0
conda activate snowpark-de-ml1
   ```

4. Install Requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```
   5. Run the app

   ```
   streamlit run your_streamlit_app.py

   ```

- 📊 Users can input data and watch as predictions for ad impressions unfold using the deployed model.

## Part 2: Test and Integrate Three Snowflake Applications 🧩

For the second part of our journey, we decided to explore three Snowflake applications. Each brought a new challenge and opportunity for us to learn. Let's dive in!

### Customer Lifetime Value Computation 💰

- For this segment of our journey, we dived deep into the articles on Medium to understand Customer Lifetime Value computation:
  - [ML on Snowflake at Scale with Snowpark, Python, and XGBoost](https://medium.com/snowflake/ml-on-snowflake-at-scale-with-snowpark-python-and-xgboost-c329c30c2feb)
  - [ML on Snowflake at Scale with Snowpark, Python, and Snowpark ML - Part 2](https://medium.com/snowflake/ml-on-snowflake-at-scale-with-snowpark-python-and-snowpark-ml-part-2-6491d72a9903)

- The code is available in the [Customer Lifetime Value](/customer_lifetime_value/) directory.

### Predict Customer Spend 🛒

- With our snow boots on, we tackled the application for predicting customer spend, and the code is available in the [Predict Customer Spend](/predict_customer_spend/) directory.

### ROI Prediction 💸

- Our journey wouldn't be complete without the ROI prediction application. We explored this field with utmost enthusiasm, and the code is available in the [ROI Prediction](/roi_prediction/) directory.

### Multipage Streamlit App 🚀

- To tie all our adventures together, we created a multipage Streamlit app that combines all three functions: Customer Lifetime Value computation, Predict Customer Spend, and ROI prediction.

   ```

4. Install Requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```
   5. Run the app

   ```
