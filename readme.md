# Assignment README 🚀

Welcome to our data science project! This repository contains the completed assignments for a data-driven adventure where we harnessed the power of Snowflake and created a dynamic Streamlit app to explore the world of data.

## Part 1: Predict Ad Impressions with Snowflake 📈

### Tutorial Completion ✅

In the first leg of our journey, we embarked on a thrilling tutorial provided by Snowflake to predict ad impressions using ML-powered analysis. Here's what we accomplished:

- 📚 Followed the [Predict Ad Impressions Tutorial](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/predict_ad_impressions_with_ml_powered_analysis/index.html#0) on Snowflake's website.

- 🚀 Successfully deployed the ad impressions prediction model.

### Streamlit App 🌟

To make our journey even more exciting, we built a Streamlit app that lets you interact with the ad impressions prediction model. It's a two-part adventure!

- The [Streamlit app](/streamlit_app/) directory contains the code for our interactive app.

- 📊 Users can input data and watch as predictions for ad impressions unfold using the deployed model.

## Part 2: Test and Integrate Three Snowflake Applications 🧩

For the second part of our journey, we decided to explore three Snowflake applications. Each brought a new challenge and opportunity for us to learn. Let's dive in!

### Customer Lifetime Value Computation 💰

- For this segment of our journey, we dived deep into the articles on Medium to understand Customer Lifetime Value computation:
  - [ML on Snowflake at Scale with Snowpark, Python, and XGBoost](https://medium.com/snowflake/ml-on-snowflake-at-scale-with-snowpark-python-and-xgboost-c329c30c2feb)
  - [ML on Snowflake at Scale with Snowpark, Python, and Snowpark ML - Part 2](https://medium.com/snowflake/ml-on-snowflake-at-scale-with-snowpark-python-and-snowpark-ml-part-2-6491d72a9903)

- The code is available in the [Customer Lifetime Value](/customer_lifetime_value/) directory.

### Predict Customer Spend 🛒

- With our snow boots on, we tackled the application for predicting customer spend, and the code is available in the [Predict Customer Spend](/predict_customer_spend/) directory.

### ROI Prediction 💸

- Our journey wouldn't be complete without the ROI prediction application. We explored this field with utmost enthusiasm, and the code is available in the [ROI Prediction](/roi_prediction/) directory.

### Multipage Streamlit App 🚀

- To tie all our adventures together, we created a multipage Streamlit app that combines all three functions: Customer Lifetime Value computation, Predict Customer Spend, and ROI prediction.

- The [Streamlit multipage app](/multipage_streamlit_app/) directory contains the code for our grand finale!

## How to Use 📋

We want you to join our adventure! Detailed instructions on how to run and use the applications are provided in the respective subdirectories for each part of the assignment.
